# clock-mon

This is a small project to monitor the pendulum of a grandfather clock using an ESP8266 and an optical interrupt sensor. Total cost maybe $5 if you are 
prepared to wait (by direct ordering from China). Maybe $15 if you want to get the parts from Amazon. 

This just records when the pendulum breaks the light beam and timestamps it. This then gets sent to an MQTT server where it can be picked up by any other application. 
There are no such other applications at present, but there will be.
